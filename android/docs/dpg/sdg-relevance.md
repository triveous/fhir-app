# SDG Relevance for Aarogya Aarohan

Aarogya Aarohan is a mobile healthcare application designed to address critical healthcare challenges in India, particularly focusing on early detection and screening of oral cancer. The application directly contributes to multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as outlined below.

## Primary SDG: SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-being

### Target 3.4: Reduce Premature Mortality from Non-Communicable Diseases
**By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment**

**How Aarogya Aarohan Addresses This Target:**
- **Early Detection**: Enables ASHA workers to conduct oral cancer screening in communities
- **Prevention**: Identifies high-risk individuals through questionnaire-based assessments
- **Treatment Referral**: Facilitates timely referral to healthcare facilities for confirmed cases
- **Data Collection**: Captures screening data to track prevention efforts and outcomes

**Evidence**: The application includes specialized questionnaires for oral cancer screening, image capture capabilities for lesion documentation, and referral mechanisms to connect patients with appropriate healthcare providers.

### Target 3.8: Universal Health Coverage
**Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services**

**How Aarogya Aarohan Addresses This Target:**
- **Accessibility**: Provides healthcare tools accessible to ASHA workers in rural and underserved areas
- **Quality Services**: Standardizes screening protocols to ensure consistent quality
- **Financial Protection**: Reduces costs through early detection and prevention
- **Service Delivery**: Enables healthcare services to reach communities that lack traditional healthcare infrastructure

**Evidence**: The application is designed for use by frontline health workers (ASHA workers) who serve as the primary healthcare interface in rural communities, extending healthcare access to populations that would otherwise have limited access to screening services.

### Target 3.c: Health Workforce Development
**Substantially increase health financing and the recruitment, development, training and retention of the health workforce**

**How Aarogya Aarohan Addresses This Target:**
- **Workforce Empowerment**: Equips ASHA workers with digital tools to enhance their capabilities
- **Skill Development**: Provides training and support for digital healthcare delivery
- **Retention**: Improves job satisfaction through better tools and clearer impact measurement
- **Efficiency**: Enables health workers to serve more patients effectively

**Evidence**: The application includes comprehensive training modules and user-friendly interfaces designed specifically for ASHA workers, enabling them to conduct sophisticated healthcare screening without requiring advanced medical training.

## Secondary SDG: SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure

### Target 9.c: Access to Information and Communications Technology
**Significantly increase access to information and communications technology and strive to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet**

**How Aarogya Aarohan Addresses This Target:**
- **Mobile Technology**: Leverages widely available Android smartphones for healthcare delivery
- **Offline Capability**: Functions in areas with limited internet connectivity
- **Data Synchronization**: Efficiently syncs data when connectivity is available
- **Technology Adoption**: Promotes the use of mobile technology for healthcare in rural areas

**Evidence**: The application is built on the Android platform, which has high penetration in India, and includes offline functionality to ensure service delivery in areas with poor connectivity.

## Additional SDG Contributions

### SDG 1: No Poverty
**Indirect contribution through improved health outcomes that reduce healthcare costs and improve productivity**

### SDG 4: Quality Education
**Supports health education and awareness through the screening process**

### SDG 5: Gender Equality
**Ensures equal access to healthcare screening for all genders**

### SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities
**Reduces healthcare access inequalities between urban and rural populations**

### SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals
**Demonstrates successful partnership between technology (ARTPARK), healthcare (ASHA workers), and government (healthcare system)**

## Impact Measurement

The application contributes to SDG monitoring through:
- **Data Collection**: Captures screening outcomes and referral data
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors screening coverage and detection rates
- **Outcome Measurement**: Tracks treatment initiation and follow-up rates
- **Geographic Mapping**: Identifies underserved areas for targeted interventions

## Conclusion

Aarogya Aarohan directly addresses SDG 3 targets through its focus on early detection and prevention of oral cancer, while also contributing to SDG 9 through its innovative use of mobile technology for healthcare delivery. The application's design for use by ASHA workers ensures that it reaches the most vulnerable populations, making significant progress toward universal health coverage and reducing health inequalities.
